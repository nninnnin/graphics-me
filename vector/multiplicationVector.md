### 벡터를 곱한다

When we talk about multiplying a vector, what we typically mean is scaling a vector.

If we wanted to scale a vector to twice its size or one-third of its size, we would say 'Multiply the vector by 2' or 'Multiply the vector by 1/3'.

Note that we are multiplying a vector by a scalar, a single number, not another vector.

### More Number Properties with Vectors

As with addition, basic algebraic rules of multiplication apply to vectors.

- **The associative rule**

```
(n * m) * \vec{v} = n * (m * \vec{v})
```

- **The distributive rule** with 2 scalars, 1 vector

```
(n + m) * \vec{v} = n * \vec{v} + m * \vec{v}
```

- **The distributive rule** with 2 vectors, 1 scalar

```
(\vec{u} + \vec{v}) * n = \vec{u} * n + \vec{v} * n
```
